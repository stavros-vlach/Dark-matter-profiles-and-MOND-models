Here we present some papers along with comments

## Good stuff

1. arXiv:1805.11067v3
<> Eq. 4.5 is the correction added on the total velocity budget via Yukawa term added to the potential and 
assuming as a source the NFW profile. So they still have Dark Matter, but they also have modified gravity.

<> They do not fit the whole SPARC but rather, they fit subsamples.

<> They found that their modification outperforms NFW alone in the light of Bayesian evidence

<> They calculate bayesian evidence via an analytical formula assuming gaussian likelihood (ok) and priors (?)

<> They assume a c - M_200 correlation.

*What can we do with these*
We can use the full SPARC dataset and compare the fitting results of their 4.5 eq with pure einasto, pure NFW, isothermal etc.


2. 2.978-3-031-26618-8.pdf 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1463

<> They fit Tensor - Vector - Scalar gravity. However the set particular values for the free parameters of the theory, as it is highly non linear (a set of DEs must be solved for each parameter set)

<> They do not provide much details, i suspect very rough approximations.

*What can we do with these*
Perhaphs we can redo their calculations more accurately, while allowing more free parameters for the fit.


3. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11790

<> They have \phi(R) expressions and discussion for the free parameters for 2 f(R) models (eq. 7, 8) and eq 13 is the rotation curve for asymptotically-safe QG

<> At https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.2286 the asymptotically safe QG curves are fitted to just two galaxies namely NGC 4494 and NGC 4374 that they do not exist on sparc.

<> They do not directly discuss SPARC dataset

<> They discuss local and global free parameters of the models.

*What can we do with these*
We can extract the rotation curves and fit them directly to the SPARC dataset. 


4. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.0752

<> eq 58 is the rotation curve

<> this paper is old, 11 years before today, so we need to check if there exeist subsequent works

*What can we do with these*
We fit eq58 directly to the SPARC dataset.

<> They produce \phi(r) for Aether Scalar Tensor theory

*What can we do with these*
We can extract the rotation curves and fit them directly to the SPARC dataset. 

6. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05185

<> eq 18 is the total rotation curve 

<> They fit a list of 104 galaxies, some of them are from SPARC and some are from elsewhere.

<> At the end of section IV, they have a rather interesting discussion along with refs, regarding data.

<> They do NOT discuss their fitting procedure, neither they compare their results with classical DM halos.

*What can we do with these*
We can fit the rotation curves directly to the SPARC dataset and compare them. 

7. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00737

<> The main idea is rather interesting; However the paper is not published in a good journal and there is not many citations

<> The \phi(R) is given at eq 21. 

*What can we do with these*
We can extract the rotation curves and fit them directly to the SPARC dataset. However this paper is not very knon so we leave it for now.

## Rather useless stuff

<> Grumiler's gravity seems to be mostly forgotten.
